==========================================

This snippet is for use with MODx Revolution. LexiconHelper is a utility to help MODX add-on developers create and check lexicon files for their components. Note that this is *not* a tool for translators.

Once you have put lexicon strings in your code, LexiconHelper finds them and creates output that can be pasted into a lexicon file, so all you need to do is type in the strings you want to appear.

LexiconHelper will also check your code against an existing language file and report on missing or misspelled keys, empty strings, and strings in the language file that are not used in the code.

For more information about using lexicon strings to internationalize your component go [here](http://rtfm.modx.com/display/revolution20/Internationalization).
